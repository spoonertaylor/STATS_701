# STATS_701 Course Work

My course work from STATS 701: Data Analysis in Python at the University of Michigan from Winter 2018.

The course was taught by Keith Leven from the University of Michigan Statistics program. 

All course work was provided by Dr. Leven and the University of Michigan. Course work was in the form of homework assignments. While all the work throughout this semester is my own work (with collaboration of notes, peers, GSI and other resources), I do not own the material provided. **It should not be used to copy for future semesters of this course.**

As the name suggests, the focus of this course was to develop data analysis skills in the Python programming language. The course started with basic Python skills and developed. Topics of this course were:

* Data Types Functions and Conditionals
